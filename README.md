Unofficial AppImage of Steam built on top of "Conty", the portable Arch Linux container that runs everywhere.

This includes 32bit libraries needed to run Steam, also it downloads and installs in ~/.local/share/Conty a portable version of Nvidia drivers if needed.


---------------------------------

### Features

- [Patched EAC-Glibc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhseQ0Kfe5w).
- `steam-screensaver-fix` which fixes the [issue](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/5607) that Steam disables the screensaver even when no game is running.
- `zenity-gtk3` which prevents the broken theme issues of the gtk4 version, aka [flashbang](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamOS/issues/1534).
- Bundles its own mesa from Arch Linux, so you don't have to deal with [outdated mesa](https://www.reddit.com/r/yuzu/comments/11307f0/glitches_on_steam_deck_flatpak_version_dont/j8o6gsa/) versions causing issues.
- "sudo" is not required, no need enable 32 bit repo, no need to install flatpak or snap, **it should even run on musl distros.**
- Can use a [portable home](https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/portable-mode.html), so you can avoid all the [mess that Steam leaves in $HOME](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/1890) and no need to settle with a hardcoded `~/.var` or `~/snap` either.
- Uses a patched bubblewrap that [allows](https://github.com/flathub/com.valvesoftware.Steam/issues/770) launching AppImages from Steam.

---------------------------------

### How it works

1. Download the AppImage from https://github.com/ivan-hc/Steam-appimage/releases/latest
2. Made it executable
```
chmod a+x ./*.AppImage
```
3. Run it, do this the first time from terminal, since the internal "Conty" script may detect if you need Nvidia drivers for your GPU
```
./*.AppImage
```
this may need seconds before you can use Steam.

This AppImage does NOT require libfuse2, being it a new generation one.

---------------------------------

### How to build it

Currently, the AppImage I produced contains the following structure:
```
|---- AppRun
|---- steam.desktop
|---- steam.png
|---- conty.sh
```
1. The AppRun is the core script of the AppImage
2. The .desktop file of Steam
3. The icon of Steam
4. The Arch Linux container named "conty.sh", it contains Steam.

Points 1, 2 and 3 are the essential elements of any AppImage.

The script "conty.sh" (4) is the big one among the elements of this AppImage.

This is what each file of my workflow is ment for:
1. [create-arch-bootstrap.sh](https://github.com/ivan-hc/Steam-appimage/blob/main/create-arch-bootstrap.sh) creates an Arch Linux chroot, where Steam is installed. This is the first script to be used ("root" required);
2. [create-conty.sh](https://github.com/ivan-hc/Conty/blob/master/create-conty.sh) is the second script used in this process, it converts the Arch Linux chroot created by "create-arch-bootstrap.sh" into a big script named "conty.sh", that includes "conty-start.sh";
3. [conty-start.sh](https://github.com/ivan-hc/Conty/blob/master/conty-start.sh) is the script responsible of startup inizialization processes to made Conty work. It includes a function that detects the version of the Nvidia drivers needed, if they are needed, the script downloads and installs them in ~/.local/share/Conty. Also it is responsible of full integration of Conty with the host system, using "bubblewrap;
4. [utils_dwarfs.tar.gz](https://github.com/ivan-hc/Conty/releases/download/utils/utils_dwarfs.tar.gz) contains "dwarfs", a set of tools similar to squashfs to compress filesystems, and it is needed to compress "conty.sh" as much as possible;
5. [steam-conty-builder.sh](https://github.com/ivan-hc/Steam-appimage/blob/main/steam-conty-builder.sh) is a script i wrote to pundle "conty.sh" near the AppRun, the .desktop file and the icon to convert everything into an AppImage. It is ment to be used in github actions.

Files 1, 2, 3 and 4 come from my fork of https://github.com/Kron4ek/Conty

Files 1, 2 and 3 are a mod of the original ones to made them smaller and with only what its needed to made Steam work.

## Known issues

### â—† Very slow first startup for Nvidia users
At the first start, if necessary, the drivers for your video card will be downloaded, via Conty (see screenshot above). This may take several seconds or even minutes. This behaviour will only be noticed if when you first start it, you launch Steam from the terminal instead of using the launcher.

*"AM"/"AppMan" is a set of scripts and modules for installing, updating, and managing AppImage packages and other portable formats, in the same way that APT manages DEBs packages, DNF the RPMs, and so on... using a large database of Shell scripts inspired by the Arch User Repository, each dedicated to an app or set of applications.*

*The engine of "AM"/"AppMan" is the "APP-MANAGER" script which, depending on how you install or rename it, allows you to install apps system-wide (for a single system administrator) or locally (for each user).*

*"AM"/"AppMan" aims to be the default package manager for all AppImage packages, giving them a home to stay.*

*You can consult the entire **list of managed apps** at [**portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps**](https://portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps).*
